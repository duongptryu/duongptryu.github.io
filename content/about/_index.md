Hello! My name is Duong, and I am a backend web developer with a strong foundation in Golang. I have been working with Golang for the past 2 years and have gained a solid understanding of its capabilities and limitations. In addition to my experience with Golang, I have also spent the last 5 months working with DevOps and another 5 months working with blockchain technology. I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest developments in the tech industry.

In the short term, I am focused on improving my skills in Golang in deeper , specifically in the areas of system programming and algorithms. I believe that a strong foundation in these areas will enable me to tackle even the most difficult challenges that may arise in my work as a backend web developer.  I believe that a strong understanding of how systems work and how to optimize them for different scenarios is crucial for any backend developer, and I am eager to learn as much as I can in this area. By focusing on these areas of study in the short term, I hope to become a more well-rounded and effective developer who is able to take on any challenge that comes my way.

In the long term, I hope to combine my skills in backend web development with a strong foundation in DevOps and blockchain. I believe that these technologies will play an increasingly important role in the future of the tech industry, and I want to be at the forefront of their development. By combining my expertise in web development with a deep understanding of DevOps and blockchain, I hope to become a valuable asset to any company that I work for.
